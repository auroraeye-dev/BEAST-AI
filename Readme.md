## 🧠 Architecture Overview

Beast AI follows a component-based design:
- **Input Layer**: Microphone capture and speech recognition  
- **Processing Layer**: Intent handling and AI reasoning via OpenAI  
- **Automation Layer**: Web control and task execution  
- **Output Layer**: Voice and text responses  

This structure allows new capabilities to be added without modifying core logic.
